# This is a MERN stack project.

## Project description:
This project is a dynamic personal website developed for journalist Kamrul Hasan. It serves as an interactive platform to showcase his writings, reflections, experiences, and published reports, offering readers valuable insights into various topics.

The website is primarily in Bengali, targeting Bengali-speaking audiences, and is designed with a focus on readability, user engagement, and content accessibility.

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the platform ensures high performance, scalability, and flexibility. From top to bottom, every section of the website is fully dynamic and customizable through its powerful admin panel, allowing seamless management of content, including articles, reports, multimedia, and even the websiteâ€™s menu structure.

This dynamic architecture not only simplifies content management but also empowers the journalist to maintain and update the site without technical assistance, ensuring that the content stays fresh and relevant.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
